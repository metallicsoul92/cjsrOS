------------------------
Clims Thoughts:


We should use either CMake or a simple build script (build.sh) Either can work

Platforms: The More the merrier

Kernel Should have structures for versioning, Architecture type, the bit amount (32,64) ,
Kernel should also have memory management, task scheduling, probably use the Inode structure for that,


LibC should be POSIX Compliant. All Posix headers will be implemented. This is necesarry
The way LibC works, is it usually hooks to to kernel functions. such as printf, if compiling as a kernel C lib, will use the terminal_write function

Modules:
	We can use modules for things like filesystem, Rammodule, certain drivers
