OS Name: CJSR OS (Working Name)
Authors: ClimJark

Platform/s : 32-bit
Build System: mix of build.sh and cmake for libre-c

Kernel:
	Theory:
	Kernel Should have structures for versioning, Architecture type, the bit amount (32,64) ,
	Kernel should also have memory management, task scheduling, probably use the Inode structure for that,

Lib-C:
	Implementation of Libre-C. 
	Theory: 
	LibC should be POSIX Compliant. All Posix headers will be implemented. This is necesarry
	The way LibC works, is it usually hooks to to kernel functions. such as printf, if compiling 
	as a kernel C lib, will use the terminal_write function


Modules:
	Theory:
	We can use modules for things like filesystem, Rammodule, certain drivers
